# Spectral Denoising CycleGAN

Training/validation/test data can be downloaded from this [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1d7KSXt-ZDyDc_YGKFiEZV5ckLYmrl6y8?usp=sharing).

The original spectral dataset adapted for this study can be found [here](https://github.com/conor-horgan/DeepeR). 
# to do:

- cite original cyclegan paper
- last adjustments to figures
- check refs
- add pearsons score in text
- compute validation loss for an epoch using baseline corrected/normalised spectra
- mention why baseline corrected spectra are used for test comparison
- add error metrics for non-baseline corrected spectra?
