# spec-super-res-gan

The numpy files `noisy_data.npy` and `denoised_data.npy` can be downloaded from this [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1owS0jEbU93z9XDw_owVr5Fti1AVfQzL0?usp=sharing).

# TO DO:
- Expand implementation of classical denoising techniques (see denoising notebook)
- Assess performance of each denoising technique with ANOVA (https://www.pythonfordatascience.org/anova-python/) and MSE - this should be its own distinct notebook
- Implement cycleGAN in pytorch
