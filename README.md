The numpy files `noisy_data.npy` and `denoised_data.npy` can be downloaded from this [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1owS0jEbU93z9XDw_owVr5Fti1AVfQzL0?usp=sharing).

# TO DO:
- Implement 'classical' denoising approaches on test data (SG filtering, PCA, wavelet, denoising AE) (instructions for first three are described in the Horgan paper. 
- Assess performance of each denoising technique with ANOVA and MSE
- Implement cycleGAN in pytorch
